This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history, which helps in customer segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used should contain the following columns:
•⁠  ⁠⁠ total_spent ⁠: The total amount spent by the customer.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ avg_spent_per_visit ⁠: The average amount spent per visit.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ num_of_visits ⁠: The number of visits made by the customer.

An example dataset can be in ⁠ CSV ⁠ format (e.g., ⁠ customer_data.csv ⁠):

```csv
total_spent,avg_spent_per_visit,num_of_visits
5000,200,25
8000,400,20
